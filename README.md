# MetaBond Network

## Project Description

MetaBond Network is a decentralized blockchain platform that revolutionizes the traditional bond market by enabling transparent, secure, and efficient issuance, trading, and management of digital bonds. Built on Ethereum, this smart contract solution eliminates intermediaries, reduces costs, and provides real-time settlement for bond transactions.

The platform allows bond issuers (governments, corporations, or institutions) to create digital bonds with customizable parameters including face value, maturity dates, and coupon rates. Investors can purchase these bonds directly on-chain and claim periodic coupon payments automatically, bringing unprecedented transparency and efficiency to fixed-income securities.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize access to the global bond market by leveraging blockchain technology. MetaBond Network aims to:

- **Eliminate Barriers**: Remove traditional intermediaries and reduce entry barriers for both issuers and investors
- **Enhance Transparency**: Provide complete visibility into bond issuance, ownership, and payment schedules
- **Enable Global Access**: Allow participants from anywhere in the world to issue and invest in bonds 24/7
- **Reduce Costs**: Significantly lower transaction costs associated with bond trading and settlement
- **Automate Payments**: Implement smart contract-based coupon payments and maturity settlements
- **Build Trust**: Create an immutable record of all bond transactions and ownership changes

By bridging traditional finance with decentralized technology, MetaBond Network seeks to create a more inclusive, efficient, and transparent fixed-income market for the digital age.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Hardhat development environment
- MetaMask or compatible Web3 wallet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/metabond-network.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd metabond-network

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key_here
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key_here
```

### Hardhat Configuration

Create a `hardhat.config.js` file:

```javascript
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");
require("dotenv").config();

module.exports = {
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.19",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200
      }
    }
  },
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      chainId: 1337
    },
    localhost: {
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545"
    },
    sepolia: {
      url: `https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/${process.env.INFURA_API_KEY}`,
      accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY]
    },
    mainnet: {
      url: `https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/${process.env.INFURA_API_KEY}`,

npx hardhat node

# In a new terminal, deploy
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

#### Deploy to Testnet (Sepolia)

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network sepolia
```

```

## Usage Examples

### Issuing a Bond

```javascript
const bondName = "Corporate Bond 2025";
const faceValue = ethers.utils.parseEther("1"); // 1 ETH per bond
const maturityDate = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + (365 * 24 * 60 * 60); // 1 year
const couponRate = 500; // 5% annual rate
const totalSupply = 1000; // 1000 bonds

await project.issueBond(
  bondName,
  faceValue,
  maturityDate,
  couponRate,
  totalSupply
);
```

### Purchasing Bonds

```javascript
const bondId = 1;
const amount = 10; // Purchase 10 bonds
const bond = await project.bonds(bondId);
const totalCost = bond.faceValue.mul(amount);

await project.purchaseBond(bondId, amount, { value: totalCost });
```

### Claiming Coupons

```javascript
const bondId = 1;
await project.claimCoupon(bondId);
```
